So, I had just relocated with my family to the UK. Freezing temperatures immediately welcomed us, I shivered from the airport to the house. The culture shock was another thing. We felt like aliens on a strange planet. I immediately realized I talked funny and dressed differently. But, ‘different’ is fine.

I was desperate to work and start earning ‘my precious’ (in Smiggle’s voice) pounds, however, my previous job in my country did not quite fit immediately into my new life in the UK, so I decided to transition to Tech.

I wanted to become a UX Designer so I quickly enrolled in the Google UX design course, only a few weeks into my program, I saw an ad for a boot camp in front-end web development/UX, (_I think these ad guys are just some weird wizards though_) and somehow, my mind completely ignored part A and focused completely on the ‘UX’ part, so I enrolled and got picked, and since it was fully funded, I just could not resist this. Free stuff!!!

Once I saw ‘UX’, I assumed it was about UX design. but to my utter shock, it was mostly about my most dreaded subject: PROGRAMMING! To be more specific, CODING.

Come with me on this amazing experience and find out how I squiggled my way through this Bootcamp while learning to code in the process, only more fun this time. FYI, I completed the Bootcamp, with good grades even.

If you plan on enrolling in a coding boot camp, and you are new to coding, chances are, you will struggle like me, but, you don’t have to. You can learn a thing or two from my struggle and stay afloat through this rigorous process.

This series will attempt to exemplify the process of learning to code for a complete beginner, by using the following strategies:

- Storytelling
- Code slides
- Hints/ memory clues
- Possible interview questions
